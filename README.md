## Machine Learning Examples

This repository contains examples of machine learning tasks implemented in Python using various libraries such as NLTK, BeautifulSoup, NumPy, Pandas, and more.

## Introduction

Machine learning (ML) is an umbrella term for solving problems for which the development of algorithms by human programmers would be cost-prohibitive. 
Instead, these problems are solved by helping machines 'discover' their 'own' algorithms. Recently, generative artificial neural networks have been able to 
surpass results of many previous approaches. ML approaches have been applied to various domains such as large language models, computer vision, speech recognition,
email filtering, agriculture, and medicine.
